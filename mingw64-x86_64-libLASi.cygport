VERSION=1.1.1
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="PostScript C++ stream output interface library for Win64 toolchain"
DESCRIPTION="libLASi is a library that provides a C++ stream output interface
(with operator <<) for creating Postscript documents that can contain
characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks supported in Unicode and
by Owen Taylor's Pango layout engine. The library accomodates right-to-left
scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew as easily as left-to-right scripts. Indic and
Indic-derived Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts, such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao,
and Tibetan are supported to the extent provided by Pango and by the OpenType
fonts installed on your system. All of this is provided without need for any
special configuration or layout calculation on the programmer's part."
